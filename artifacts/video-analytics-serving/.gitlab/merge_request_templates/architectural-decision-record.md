# Title (Brief Meaningful Title)

Describe the problem statement, context, and/or rationale for the proposal being made. Describe the basic technical requirements along with the underlying technical, business, or strategic issues / motivations. The section should describe the facts and be value neutral. In ADR examples found online this section is generally labeled _Context_. For simplicity we've chosen to forego the separate section heading and use the first section immediately following the ADR title. This section may contain a list of specific questions in addition to introductory material. This section is intended as a summary and may refer to the background section for more detailed information if needed. The context should be written with the intended audience in mind (i.e. a person engaged and working in the project). It is not meant to provide the context required for someone not familiar with the basic architecture or goals of the project but can refer to other ADRs or documents whose purpose is to provide that background. Provide the context and background relevant for the discussion / component at hand.

Note: The title and context are meant for the intended audience. If you have a question on why something is titled or described a certain way - reach out to the authors for clarification.

## Decision

Summarize the proposal in a few paragraphs with as much detail as required. ADRs documenting high level design will often require diagrams. Please see gitlab's integration of mermaid / plantuml support. Focus on the details which support the constraints / requirements / rationale outlined in the context section. Section is free form (may have links to additional information, sub-sections, tables, diagrams, etc.).

 _Note_: The decision section represents the fully formed recommendation / proposal of the authors. It is not a _ratified_ decision until the status is moved to _Accepted_.

 _Note_: Consider adding a _Rationale_ sub-section to help articulate the key arguments in favor of the decision. A _Rationale_ sub-section is optional. See [Architecture Decision Records in Action](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/Presentation/2017_017_001_497746.pdf) for an example.
